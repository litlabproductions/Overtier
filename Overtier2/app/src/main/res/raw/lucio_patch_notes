- Hero Balance Change
Ultimate costs have been increased by 25% for all heroes


- Developer Comment
Game-changing ultimate abilities were coming up a bit too frequently. This change helps keep them in check while still allowing them to be powerful.


- Amp It Up
Healing per second has been decreased by 10%


- Developer Comment
Lúcio’s overall healing output has always been on par with (or even higher) than Overwatch’s other healers, and his other benefits made him an almost mandatory pick.

When activating the "Needs healing" communication while targeting a teammatill now tell allies to group up to receive healing. A marker will also appear above the player's head, allowing teammates to locate the healer more quickly.
Hero Balance Update
Ultimates that consume the ultimate meter when activated will now drain the meter more quickly (.25 second instead of 1 second)
Reverted a recent change that reduced the size of heroes' projectiles
Most hero abilities will no longer interrupt quick melee attacks
Ultimate abilities will now interrupt quick melee attacks


- Developer Comments
Altering the size of projectiles in flight had too many unintended side effects to keep in the game, at least in its current form. We will continue watching this and make additional changes if necessary. We’re also making quick melee more consistent when interacting with enemy abilities.


- Amp It Up
The boosting of movement speed has been decreased by 30% (from a 100% increase to a 70% increase)


- Developer Comments
Thanks to Lúcio's speed increase, he was almost a must pick in every lineup.

- Developer Comments
Lúcio has often felt like a must-pick due to his raw healing output and the versatility of providing a speed bonus to your entire team. The goal of these changes is to keep those elements feeling strong, but making them harder to apply to everyone on your team at all times. The end result is that he should feel stronger with teams that he can stay close to but not as strong when on teams with heroes that are often spread out (such as Pharah, Widow, Genji, etc). Much of Lúcio’s character power was tied up in his large passive auras, which caused other elements of his kit to be weakened over time in an attempt to balance him. Now that his auras are more focused it will allow them to be much stronger and allow Lúcio to be more active in his role.
